## About Me
I am a data professional with expertise in data science, fraud detection, AML policy design, and financial crime analytics. I work with databases, Python, and visualization tools to transform raw data into clear, actionable insights. My experience bridges compliance, fraud prevention, and applied data and machine learning projects.

I have developed interactive dashboards, automated transaction monitoring workflows, and applied statistical analysis to real-world financial data. I am driven by solving problems that safeguard people and organizations, using data as the link between risk and strategy.
